<h1>My experience during RMO</h1>
<p>I would like to share my experience dealing with Restriction Movement Order. We all aware that the world are dealing with a dangerous virus named Corona Virus. This virus can kill human being if they get infected. This virus can infect humans easily. This can infect by touching people that have this virus. That is why all of us need to obey the RMO, it is to help us from being infected by that virus. </p>
<p2>My precious mother would cook different type of food to make sure that me and my siblings always happy during RMO. My family and I also do some outdoor activities together so that we would not feel bored at home. This also would cheer up my little brother so that he would not feel bored by staying at home. It is because he was a active boy and my mother does want him to spend all day playing online games.</p2>

<p3>When there online classes with the lecturer, I would stay in my room and do my work because I want to finish up my assignment as soon as possible. Once I have finished doing my assignment, I would help my mother with the chores. My advice to all people in Malaysia, take a good care of yourself and stay at home. We must make sure that Malaysia is free from Coronavirus. Thank you for the Frontliners that have keep us all save from this virus.</p3>
