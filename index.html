		<title>My motivation During online Classes</title>
	<head>An online class is a course conducted over the internet. They are generally conducted through a learning management system, in which students can view their course syllabus and academic progress, as well as communicate with fellow students and their course instructor. Online clasess is a chalenging type of learning. There are many types of motivation that would inspire me to do well in my online classes during MCO. These are the example of my motivation during online classes</head>

<h2 style="color:Tomato"><strong>My Parents</strong><br></h2>
<p>My parents always motivate me to always follow my lecture classes by waking me up in the morning and always give me word of encouragement so that I would not give up easily. This online classes is pretty hard hitting my mental but with my parents spirit and wishes, I would keep up with a good work for a better future for our family. Their dreams are the strongest motivation for me to keep up on my hardwork.</p>

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;"><strong>My Friends</strong><br></h3>
<p>My dear friends has been my motivation by teaching me any lecture that I do not understand. Eventhough we cannot meet each other but we always communicate using whatsapp and social media. We always encourage each other to keep up and always be strong so that we would not easily give up.<i>Jia you my friends</i></p>

<h4 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"><strong>Stay Positive</strong></h4>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed or getting behind can cause stress which is seriously demotivating. While it's not easy to turn a negative attitude into a positive outlook, it will definitely help you keep going when you want to procrastinate on an assignment or dont feel like logging in to attend a lecture.</p>

<p>My favourite learning quotes: <q>You'll never be brave if you don't get hurt. You'll never learn if you don't make mistakes. You'll never be successful if you don't encounter failure.</q></p>
